## Project Description

This project implements a set of functions in C to analyze an array of unsigned char data items. The functions can determine the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. Additionally, the program can sort the data set from largest to smallest and display the data in a well-formatted manner on the screen.

The project includes the following files:

- `stats.c`: Implementation file containing the C code.
- `stats.h`: Header file with function declarations and documentation.
- `README.md`: Documentation file with information about the author and the project.

## Implemented Functions

The following functions are implemented in `stats.c`:

1. **main()**: The main entry point for the program.
2. **print_statistics()**: Prints the statistics of the array, including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
3. **print_array()**: Prints the elements of a given array and its length to the screen.
4. **find_median()**: Returns the median of an array of data.
5. **find_mean()**: Returns the mean of an array of data.
6. **find_maximum()**: Returns the maximum value of an array of data.
7. **find_minimum()**: Returns the minimum value of an array of data.
8. **sort_array()**: Sorts an array of data from largest to smallest.
